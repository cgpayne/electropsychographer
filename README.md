# Goal

The aim of this project is to predict whether or not a patient has schizophrenia based on their electroencephalogram (EEG) reading using a machine learning model.

# Motivation

Schizophrenia is a devastating mental health disorder which affects approximately 1% of the population [insert: citation], meaning there are an estimated 79 million people with schizophrenia worldwide. This disorder can lead to significant disability [insert: citation], and an estimated 7% of people with schizophrenia will commit suicide in their lifetime - a 7 times higher rate than the US national average [insert: citations].

Treatment options are limited to antipsychotic medications, which carry a high burden of side effects, and varying effectivity across the patient population [insert: citation]. Nevertheless, access to treatment in a timely manner is a crucial step in the early intervention of psychotic-type illnesses, since effective treatment regimes can help a patient lead a fulfilling life.

However, a diagnosis of schizophrenia can only be made by a psychiatrist, a process which typically takes [insert: X] months [insert: citation]. This is in stark contrast to a physical disease like cancer, which has an average diagnosis time of [insert: Y] weeks from the detection of a tumour [insert: citation]. The difference is that schizophrenia currently has no physiological test - that is, there is no "litmus test" for schizophrenia, or for any known mental disorder. Establishing such tests is a major objective in the modern treatment of mental illness.

Access to a cost effective, non-invasive, rapid test for the diagnosis of patients with schizophrenia would be a major breakthrough in the field. An EEG, which records electrical activity of the brain through nodes on the head, could provide a viable candidate for a testing procedure. The average cost of an EEG reading in the United States is [insert: $Z], the procedure involves the non-invasive placement of painless electrodes on the head, and software like a machine learning algorithm can provide a rapid evaluation of an EEG.

# Solution

Here, we propose that an EEG reading provides enough information to predict whether or not a patient has schizophrenia within a high degree of accuracy. This would act as a useful augmentation strategy for a psychiatrist's diagnostic procedure. To accomplish this, we will build a machine learning model on EEG data from a population of patients with and without schizophrenia.

# Data

[insert: outline with links to Kaggle]

# Code

All the software is written in Python scripts (located in `epg/`) and Jupyter notebooks (located in `notebooks/`). Some noteable packages used are: `ts-fresh`, `scikit-learn`, and `pytorch`.
